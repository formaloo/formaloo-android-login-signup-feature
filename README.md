Every user can create an app that has the ability to signup and log in users of its own.

Check the api document:

<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="images/login.png" ></td>
<td align="center"><img src="images/signup.png"></td>
<td align="center"><img src="images/profile.png"></td>
</tr>
</table>

You can also only use data folder with your own UI design.
